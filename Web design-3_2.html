    <p>
        If only given 15 minutes to consume content, 66 percent of people would prefer to see something beautifully
        designed versus something plain and simple. Your website’s design is an important part of your online marketing
        presence.<br>
        To build a better website for your business, you must understand the importance of web design. If your website
        looks unappealing or outdated, your audience will immediately have a negative impression of your business. They
        won’t find your website appealing, which deters them from your page. You’ll miss out on leads because they’ll
        leave your page for a competitor’s page.<br>
        Web design is important because it impacts how your audience perceives your brand. The impression you make on
        them can either get them to remain on your page and learn about your business or leave your page and turn to a
        competitor. A good web design helps you keep your leads on your page.<br>


        <h3>What makes a good web design?</h3>
       <b> Usability</b><br>
        Users want to be able to USE your website. Research shows that 86% of your website visitors want to see product
        or service information, 65% look for contact information, and 52% seek an About page for your business. Good
        website design ensures that users can find what they’re looking for quickly. Good design also alters people’s
        perceptions of usability. So even if your website is laid out perfectly for your customers, they will not find
        interacting with it enjoyable if they don’t enjoy looking at it -- and you can start by using easy to read
        design fonts. <br><br>

        <b>Navigation</b><br>
        Navigation refers to the way that users get around your website. Website navigation that requires users to
        actively look for the information they need is a quick way to drive visitors away from your site. Your site’s
        navigation should be easy to figure out and should lead users to the information they need to purchase your
        company’s products and/or services. <br><br>

        <b>Content</b><br>
        The content and visual elements of your website are also important. There should be a good balance between text
        and pictures on your site. Visitors will not want to wade through a site that’s all text, nor will they want to
        spend time on a site that’s all pictures and no information. Your content should also be easy to read and
        engaging to keep visitors’ attention. <br>
