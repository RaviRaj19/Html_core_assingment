    <h2><u>full stack web development tech stack</u></h2>

    lets start first understand <b>What is a tech stack?</b>

    <p>A tech stack is a combination of programming languages, databases, and frameworks used to create a web
        application or website.
        <br> A typical web development stack is usually a mix of front-end and back-end technologies that include:<br><br>
        <b>Framework:</b> Libraries of code written by other developers. These can help you build a web application without
        starting from scratch.<br>
        <b>Web server/HTTP servers:</b> The HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) server handles requests such as sending or
        receiving emails, downloading files, etc.<br>
        <b>Databases:</b> A database stores and organizes data. The data can be retrieved, manipulated, updated, and managed in
        a variety of different ways.<br>
        <b>Programming languages:</b> These are used to communicate instructions in a way that is understandable by computers.<br>
        <b>Operating systems (OS):</b> Software that manages the hardware, software, and other applications or resources of a
        computer.<br>

            <u>
                <li>MEAN
            </u>
    </h3>
    One of the well-known tech stacks, MEAN brings numerous benefits to web developers. Among these benefits are
    the use of a single language (JavaScript) and the underlying technologies are open source and free. MEAN
    consists of:<br><br>

    <b>MongoDB (NoSQL database)<br>
        Express.js backend web framework<br>
        Angular.js frontend framework<br>
        Node.js server-side JavaScript<br></b><br>
    MEAN provides a practical approach to creating fast and highly efficient apps. All the components speak JSON
    (JavaScript Object Notations) for data transmission and free module library access. This tech stack helps to
    build scalable software products. It’s great for all types of websites and interactive applications.

    <h3>
        <li>
            <u>MERN</u>
    </h3>
    Essentially MERN is similar to MEAN. The difference is that you change Angular.js with React.
    The key benefits of using MERN are the React integration, the ability to use code on browsers and servers
    simultaneously, powerful library, and full-stack development option (frontend and backend).
    Additionally, React is known for its flexibility and performance in developing interactive user interfaces.

    <h3>
        <li><u>ASP.NET</u>
    </h3>
    Microsoft’s .NET Core has been growing in popularity in recent years. Modern .NET applications are very lightweight
    and can run on Windows and Linux.
    Microsoft’s embrace of open source technologies has caught the attention of developers all over the world. Now with
    .NET 5, you don’t have to think as much about .NET Framework vs .NET Core.
    Applications built using .NET commonly use the following application tech stack:<br>
    <b>
        ASP.NET MVC – Standard model-view-controller framework<br>
        IIS – Microsoft’s web server<br>
        Angular frontend framework with TypeScript<br>
        SQL Server – Microsoft’s enterprise database<br>
        Microsoft Azure – A favorite of most .NET developers
    </b>
    </li>

    <h3>
        <li><u>LAMP</u>
    </h3>
    LAMP is an industry-standard when it comes to tech stack models. In web development, it delivers the best cost
    efficiency, flexibility, and performance. It is an acronym that stands for:<br>
    <b>
        Linux (operating system)<br>
        Apache (HTTP server)<br>
        MySQL (relational database management)<br>
        PHP (programming language, it can also be Perl or Python)<br>
    </b>
    All these stack layers are free and open source. Since this tech stack can run on any operating system, you can
    interchange or modify other components in the same stack. Use WAMP for Microsoft Windows or MAMP for MacOS.
